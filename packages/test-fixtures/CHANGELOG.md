## 1.0.2-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- ece9c58: Generate types for empty responses

  Now, for both successful and error responses, we generate types for all possible response outcomes.
  For instance, if a 204 (No Content) response is possible, we now explicitly generate a type for it
  (represented as `undefined` in the generated code) instead of omitting it.

  Special thanks to [GauBen](https://github.com/GauBen) for implementing provenance publishing support in Yarn — this work
  inspired this change.
