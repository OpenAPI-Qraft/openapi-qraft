## Key Changes

### 1. Removal of `QraftContext`

- **Change**: The `QraftContext` has been removed in favor of a more streamlined API design in `createAPIClient`.
- **Impact**: You'll now need to provide `baseUrl` and `queryClient` directly to the `createAPIClient` function.
  This change ensures consistent API client configuration throughout your project.

### 2. Simplified `QueryClient` Usage

- **Change**: The ability to pass a `QueryClient` for individual hooks or methods has been removed.
- **Impact**: A single `QueryClient` instance is now associated with `createAPIClient`, simplifying
  the API and preventing potential configuration conflicts.

### 3. Deprecation and Removal of `mutationFn` and `queryFn` Methods

- **Change**: The legacy `mutationFn` and `queryFn` methods have been removed.
- **Impact**: You'll need to update your code to use the new API methods introduced in v2.

### 4. Error Handling Enhancements

- **Change**: The `requestFn` now returns a structured `{ data, error, response }` object instead of using Promise rejection.
- **Impact**: This change enables more robust error handling within your application. Update your error handling logic accordingly.

### 5. Updates to `qraftAPIClient`

- **Change**: The `qraftAPIClient(...)` now only returns services corresponding to methods with provided callbacks.
- **Impact**: Review your service definitions to ensure compatibility with this behavior.

## Migration Steps

1. **Update `QraftContext` Usage**: Replace all `QraftContext` implementations by passing configuration directly to `createAPIClient`.
2. **Consolidate QueryClient Usage**: Remove any per-hook or per-method `QueryClient` configurations and use the instance provided to `createAPIClient`.
3. **Update Legacy Methods**: Replace any `mutationFn` and `queryFn` usage with their v2 equivalents,
   referring to the core [Query](/core/query-operation.mdx) and [Mutation](/core/mutation-operation.mdx) documentation.
4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Update your error handling to work with the new structured response format from `requestFn`.
5. **Review Service Definitions**: Verify that your service definitions align with the new `qraftAPIClient(...)` behavior.
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure all changes work as expected and no regressions are introduced.

## Automated Migration ðŸª„

We provide a Codemod script powered by [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift)
to automate most of the migration process.

Run this command in your project root to apply the migrations:

```bash
npx jscodeshift@latest --extensions=tsx,ts --parser=tsx -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPI-Qraft/openapi-qraft/main/packages/react-client/src/migrate-to-v2-codemod.ts ./src/
```

This command will transform all `.tsx` and `.ts` files in your `src` directory.
After running the script, review the changes and make any necessary manual adjustments.

Following these steps and utilizing the automated migration tool will help you smoothly transition to OpenAPI Qraft v2
while taking advantage of its improved features and capabilities.
