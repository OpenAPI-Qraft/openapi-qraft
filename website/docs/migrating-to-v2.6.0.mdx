# Migrating to OpenAPI Qraft v2.6.0

This guide outlines the steps required to migrate your project to OpenAPI Qraft v2.6.0.
This version introduces a minor but important change to improve type inference and simplify the API.

## Why These Changes Were Necessary

While v2.6.0 is technically a minor version update, it includes a small breaking change that affects a limited number of users who work with low-level APIs. We made this decision for several important reasons:

1. **Enhanced Modularity**: The API client can now be generated in a fully modular way, supporting new options like `--create-api-client-fn` that allow for more customized client generation.

2. **More Precise Type Definitions**: To support these new options, we needed to make the return type from `—ÅreateAPIClient()` function more specific than before.

3. **Simplified Manual Creation**: When creating manually using the `qraftAPIClient()` utility, you no longer need to specify custom types.
  The `—ÅreateAPIClient()` function now acts as a direct proxy for `qraftAPIClient()`, with some additional code generation features.

4. **Increased Flexibility**: These changes significantly increase the flexibility of the API Client and simplify its maintenance going forward.

With these benefits in mind, we made the difficult decision to introduce this minor breaking change.

## Key Changes

### Removal of Generic Type Parameters from `qraftAPIClient`

- **Change**: Generic type parameters have been removed from `qraftAPIClient` function calls.
- **Impact**: You no longer need to specify `<Services, Callbacks>` when calling `qraftAPIClient`. The types are now inferred automatically from the arguments.

**Before:**
```tsx
const api = qraftAPIClient<Services, Callbacks>(services, callbacks, options);
```

**After:**
```tsx
const api = qraftAPIClient(services, callbacks, options);
```

### Type Updates Required in Contexts or Variables

- **Change**: Types created by the API client after calling `createAPIClient` may need to be updated.
- **Impact**: If you're using the return type of `createAPIClient` in contexts or other variables, you'll need to update those types.

**Before:**
```tsx
const APIContext = createContext<ReturnType<typeof createAPIClient>>>(null!);
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { type services } from './api';
import { type APIDefaultQueryClientServices } from '@openapi-qraft/react';
const APIContext = createContext<APIDefaultQueryClientServices<typeof services>>(null!);
```

## Migration Steps

1. **Run the Codemod**: Use our automated codemod to remove generic type parameters from `qraftAPIClient` calls.
2. **Update Context Types**: Update any types in contexts or variables that reference the return type of `createAPIClient`.
3. **Test Your Application**: Ensure that your application works correctly after the changes.

## Automated Migration ü™Ñ

:::note
This codemod is primarily needed for users who are writing low-level libraries or manually creating API clients without
using the generated `createAPIClient` function. Most users who rely on the generated `createAPIClient` function don't need to run this codemod.
:::

We provide a Codemod script powered by [`jscodeshift`](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift)
to automate most of the migration process.

Run this command in your project root to apply the migrations:

```bash
npx jscodeshift@latest --extensions=tsx,ts --parser=tsx -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPI-Qraft/openapi-qraft/main/packages/react-client/src/migrate-to-v2.6.0-codemod.ts ./src/
```

If you're using a custom package name (not `@openapi-qraft/react-client`), you can specify it with the `--packageName` option:

```bash
npx jscodeshift@latest --extensions=tsx,ts --parser=tsx -t https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPI-Qraft/openapi-qraft/main/packages/react-client/src/migrate-to-v2.6.0-codemod.ts --packageName='@custom/package' ./src/
```

This command will transform all `.tsx` and `.ts` files in your `src` directory.
After running the script, review the changes and make any necessary manual adjustments, especially for context types
or other variables that use the return type of `createAPIClient`.

Following these steps and utilizing the automated migration tool will help you smoothly transition to OpenAPI Qraft v2.6.0.
